This is a simulated safety system designed for under 21 Drivers Ed students who need to have direct supervision per New York's driving regulations.
By using a light indicator and buzzer it ensures an instuctor is present and buckled before the cars ignition can be pressed. If the cars ignition is pressed before 
these requirements are met, a buzzer goes off, however the user can disable the alarm by having both driver and passenger seated and buckled (turning back on the ligth indicator).
Once the ignition is on, for safety and usability we added a headlight system. This headlight system has an off setting, an on setting, and an auto setting. The auto setting turns
on the lights when it is dark out, turns off the lights when it is light out, and when it is somewhere inbetween (midlight mode) it maintains its previous state). Finally, when 
the headlights are on we added a switch to turn on the high beams.
